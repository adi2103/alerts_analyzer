════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CONVERSATION SUMMARY
* Alert Analysis System bug fix: Fixed duplicate entities appearing in query results when filtering by alert type
* Restructuring results.json format to include query metadata with saved results
* Creating a results management system with save, load, and list capabilities
* Removing alert type filtering functionality due to incorrect implementation
* Documenting known limitations and proposing future design extensions

## TOOLS EXECUTED
* Ran tests with actual data: Identified top 5 unhealthiest hosts with host-89a9a342729c4e5b having the highest unhealthy time (145,521 seconds)
* Created integration tests: Added tests to verify correct behavior with real data
* Created results management utilities: Added functionality to save results with query metadata
* Fixed duplicate entities bug: Modified get_top_k method to track processed entities
* Removed alert type filtering: Simplified implementation by removing filtering functionality
* Updated documentation: Added details about results management and known limitations

## CODE CHANGES
* Added ResultsManager class to handle saving, loading, and listing analysis results
* Modified get_top_k method to prevent duplicate entities in results:
```python
processed_entities = set()  # Track entities we've already processed
if entity_value in processed_entities:
    continue
# Process entity
processed_entities.add(entity_value)
```
* Removed alert type filtering implementation:
```python
if alert_type:
    logging.getLogger("alert_analyzer").warning(
        "Alert type filtering is not supported in this version. "
        "Returning results without filtering by alert type."
    )
```
* Created command-line tools for saving and listing results

## KEY INSIGHTS
* The original alert type filtering implementation was flawed - it ranked entities by total unhealthy time across all alert types instead of only considering time from the specified alert type
* A proper implementation would require tracking unhealthy time separately for each alert type
* The duplicate entities bug occurred because entities could appear multiple times in the ordered entities dictionary with different unhealthy times
* A modular design approach was proposed for future implementation of alert type filtering using separate indices for each alert type
* The results management system improves reproducibility by storing query parameters alongside results
