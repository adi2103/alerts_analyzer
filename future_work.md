# Alert Analysis System - Future Work

This document outlines potential future enhancements and extensions for the Alert Analysis System.

## 1. Time Range Queries

### Description
Implement support for finding unhealthy entities within specific time periods, allowing users to analyze entity health during particular time windows.

### Benefits
- Identify patterns in entity health over time
- Focus analysis on specific incidents or time periods
- Compare entity health across different time periods

### Implementation Approach
- Extend the `get_top_k` method to accept `start_time` and `end_time` parameters
- Implement the `_get_top_k_in_time_range` method to calculate unhealthy time within the specified range
- Add support for overlapping periods and partial containment
- Update the command-line interface to accept time range parameters

### Dependencies
- Existing `unhealthy_periods` tracking in the `EntityState` class
- Datetime parsing utilities

## 2. Parallel Processing

### Description
Implement parallel processing of alert events to improve performance for large datasets.

### Benefits
- Significantly faster processing of large event files
- Better utilization of multi-core systems
- Improved scalability for production environments

### Implementation Approach
- Implement data partitioning by alert ID
- Create worker processes to handle each partition
- Develop a result merging mechanism to combine results from all workers
- Add an `analyze_file_parallel` method to the `AlertAnalyzer` class

### Dependencies
- Python's `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` modules
- Thread-safe data structures or appropriate locking mechanisms

## 3. Additional Dimensions and Complex Filtering

### Description
Enhance the system to support more complex filtering criteria and cross-dimension queries.

### Benefits
- More powerful and flexible analysis capabilities
- Support for complex operational scenarios
- Better insights into relationships between different dimensions

### Implementation Approach
- Implement a more flexible filtering mechanism that accepts multiple conditions
- Add support for filtering across different dimensions
- Develop a query language or DSL for expressing complex queries
- Extend the command-line interface to support complex filters

### Dependencies
- Existing dimension indexing mechanism
- Query parsing and execution components

## 4. Alert Severity Weighting

### Description
Add support for weighting alerts based on severity, allowing for more nuanced analysis of entity health.

### Benefits
- More accurate representation of entity health
- Prioritization of critical alerts over minor ones
- Better alignment with operational impact

### Implementation Approach
- Add severity field to the `AlertEvent` model
- Implement weighting factors for different severity levels
- Modify unhealthy time calculations to account for severity
- Add severity-based filtering and sorting options

### Dependencies
- Alert severity data in the input events
- Configuration for severity weights

## 5. Visualization Capabilities

### Description
Add visualization capabilities to help users better understand patterns and trends in the alert data.

### Benefits
- Improved understanding of entity health patterns
- Easier identification of problematic entities
- Better communication of findings to stakeholders

### Implementation Approach
- Create a visualization module using matplotlib or similar libraries
- Implement various chart types (bar charts, time series, heatmaps)
- Add export options for different formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)
- Develop an interactive dashboard (optional, using tools like Dash or Streamlit)

### Dependencies
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Optional web framework for interactive dashboards

## 6. Streaming Support

### Description
Extend the system to process events in real-time from streaming sources.

### Benefits
- Near real-time analysis of entity health
- Continuous monitoring capabilities
- Integration with event streaming platforms

### Implementation Approach
- Implement connectors for common streaming platforms (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Develop a streaming processor that maintains state
- Add windowing capabilities for time-based analysis
- Implement alerting mechanisms for unhealthy entities

### Dependencies
- Streaming client libraries
- State management for continuous processing
- Alerting infrastructure

## Implementation Priority

Based on potential value and implementation complexity, we recommend the following implementation order:

1. Time Range Queries (High value, Medium complexity)
2. Additional Dimensions and Complex Filtering (High value, Medium complexity)
3. Parallel Processing (Medium value, Medium complexity)
4. Alert Severity Weighting (Medium value, Low complexity)
5. Visualization Capabilities (Medium value, Medium complexity)
6. Streaming Support (High value, High complexity)
